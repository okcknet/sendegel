											<p>In 2011, two people from The Gambia came to visit Community Volunteers Foundation. They stated that they are coming from an organization working for women’s development and child care in The Gambia and they want to collaborate with TOG. Coincidentally, İbrahim Betil was there, and he wanted to visit The Gambia to get introduced to local people and to understand the expectations for a potential collaboration. He went there two months later; after seeing the situation of the Gambians and living in their villages for a week, he came back to meet his friends. They had to make a choice: They could either to ignore the situation and leave them alone, or develop projects to contribute to humanity in a world where 1 billion people are fighting against poverty and lack of water. They took on the second one and decided to establish an association to support sustainable development projects in the least developed countries. SEN DE GEL was founded in 2012. Poverty has different meanings in Turkey and Africa. Poor people in Turkey often have access to free healthcare, primary education, soup kitchens, elders’ home, government/ municipality funds, heating aid and many official and private support organizations. Above all, there is a strong Anatolian culture. For refugees, there is monthly salary, tent cities, free education and exam-free university rights given by government. There is none of them in The Gambia. There is even no clean water to drink. Lack of water at peak, dirty drinking water is the main reason for child deaths. (If people are asking this question really to understand the situation, we suggest them to use only one tap to meet all their needs related to water.</p>

											<p>The country to be supported needs to be one of the least developed countries according to UN. The second criterion is making sure that a trusted NGO from that country applies to us for collaboration with their own will. When this first two criteria are met, the country is visited, meetings are held with local communities in villages, and high potential impactful local development projects are identified collaboratively.</p>
