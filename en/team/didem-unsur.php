<p>He was born in Istanbul in 1977 and has always been in Istanbul, except for 8 months in Izmir and 2 years in New York. Working at the General Directorate of Denizbank in 1998-2000, she decided that banking, which is her mother's favorite occupation, was not for her at all. Afterwards, it was a great chance for her to turn her volunteering work, which she started in her childhood, into a professional business life. She has been both volunteer and professional in many non-governmental organizations such as Educational Volunteers Foundation of Turkey, Community Volunteers Foundation, Positive Living Association, Tohum Autism Foundation, Gündem Children's Association, ANG Foundation Nezahat Gökyiğit Botanical Garden, New York Cares, Sen De Gel, Oy ve Ötesi, and still continues to take place. Between 2014-2019, she worked as the Country Director of Special Olympics Turkey, which is affiliated with the Special Olympics, which was active in 177 countries of the world, and returned to the Community Volunteers Foundation as the Programs Director in 2020. Her areas of interest are children's rights and rights-based studies, stray animals and youth work. Working for the benefit of people, animals and the environment is his way of life. For this reason, she never separates her life into business life and private life. Her work, every subject she volunteers and her private life are a whole for her. For this reason, she is a person with high inner peace and high motivation for life.</p>
