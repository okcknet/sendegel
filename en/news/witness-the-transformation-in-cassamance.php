					<p>Sen De Gel is playing an important role in the post civic war process of Cassamance region of Senegal, where civilians were deprived of their basic rights for 30 years. That 30-years civil war made the vulnerable communities -especially women who wanted to feed their children and send them to school in the midst of chaos – even weaker. With our “We are Planting Hope” project, we provide high quality seeds to women’s gardens where women who get by under 1 dollar come together. We are giving them hope to start a new life. Take your part in this transformative journey, let’s transform together.</p>
